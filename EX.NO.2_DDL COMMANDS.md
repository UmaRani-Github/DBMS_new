# EXP NO 2: DATA DEFINITION LANGUGE AND DATA MANIPULATION COMMANDS - CREATE, ALTER ,INSERT   
### DATE
## AIM:
To perform DDL queries and DML Queries using SQL lite.

## THEORY / PROCEDURE
### DDL (Data Definition Language)
* DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema.
* It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.
* DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data.
* These commands are normally not used by a general user, who should be accessing the database via an application.
### List of DDL commands: 
1. CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).
##### Syntax

2. DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database.
3. ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database.

4. TRUNCATE: This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
5. RENAME: This is used to rename an object existing in the database.
### DML (Data Manipulation Commands)
* The DML commands in Structured Query Language change the data present in the SQL database.
* We can easily access, store, modify, update and delete the existing records from the database using DML commands.
###  List of DML commands: 
1.SELECT Command
2.INSERT Command
3.UPDATE Command
4.DELETE Command
## Query:
### 1) Create a database studentdb

### SQL QUERY:

### OUTPUT:

### 2) Create a table student  and insert any two rows with the following fieds RegisterNumber,Name,Age,Address,Phone number

### SQL QUERY: 


### OUTPUT:

### 3) Alter the above student table by adding another attribute department

### SQL QUERY: 

### OUTPUT:

### 4) Rename the student table to mystudent

### SQL QUERY: 



### OUTPUT:

### 5) Delete the mystudent rows using truncate keyword

### SQL QUERY: 


### OUTPUT:
### 4) Drop the mystudent table
 
### SQL QUERY: 


### OUTPUT:








## Result:
         Thus the basic DDL commands in SQL are executed.
